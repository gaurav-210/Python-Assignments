# What is Git ??
Git is Created by **_Linus Trovaldus_**.(responsible for the linux kernel.)

# What Git Does ??
There are two main Reasons to Learn GIT.
1. Track changes to your code .
2. Save your code to the cloud .

# What is GitHub ??
Github is not the same as git. Github is a website/platform while git is a tool.
For Ex:- Git or Camera is just the tool, But Instagram or GitHub is the website.

And Also U can Share Your Code With Others.** Other websites such as gitlab, bitbucket which are similar to Github also exists . **Companies love it when you have a github profile and they can see your work before even calling you for an interview.**

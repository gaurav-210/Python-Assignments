# Q.1- What is an access token? Generate your access token for any API.(for example Twitter,Spotify etc).

# Ans:-

# An access token is an object encapsulating the security identity of a process or thread.[1] A token is used to make
# security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity. While a token is generally used to
# represent only security information, it is capable of holding additional free-form data that can be attached while the
#     token is being created. Tokens can be duplicated without special privilege, for example to create a new token with
#     lower levels of access rights to restrict the access of a launched application. An access token is used by Windows
#     when a process or thread tries to interact with
# objects that have security descriptors (securable objects).[1] An access token is represented by the system object of type

# Q.2- Get the IP address of some common sites like Google, Facebook by using DNS lookup.

# Q.4- What is a difference between library and API . Figure it out with examples.

# Library
#
# As per simple English terminology – A library is a collection of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing.
#
# Now put that definition in the Custom Software Development context – What will be the collection of information? And why will a developer use it for reference? The basic building block of any application is its “Code”, and there are certain functionalities that any programmer needs to use repeatedly – then why to code it every time for different applications? That’s where a ‘Library’ comes to a rescue – a chunk of pre-defined code (a collection) that you can call (use for reference) from your own code, to help you do things (similar functionality) more quickly/easily.
#
# example= NumPy , Scrapy-If you are involved in webscraping then this is a must have library for you. ,
#  wxPython- A gui toolkit for python
#
#
#
#
#
# API
#
# Unlike English, not everything in this ‘Library’ is accessible directly. There will be back-end code to support the front-end code which needs to be accessible to programmers for Custom Software Development. Now how do a programmer access this front-end code? Yeah, the API – the Interface to Library.
#
#
# An API (Application Programming Interface) are the functions/methods (the front-end code) in a library that you can call to ask it to do things for you – the interface to the library.
#
# In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.
#
# example= When used in the context of web development, an API is typically defined a set of specifications , such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request messages, along with a definition of the structure of response messages, which is usually in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format
